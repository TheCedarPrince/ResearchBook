## Creating Research Directions

The distinguishing feature between research directions and research ideas is a matter of pinning.
Generally, up until now, the ideation is fantastic.
It is playful, it is creative, and it is unfettered by any barrier.

A research direction however, requires one to define what it is they want to pursue.
An idea is only an idea, until it is succinctly communicated.
That communication, too early, can be a negative barrier to creativity as one may not have had enough time to play with the thoughts.
It is a balancing act of determining at what phase an idea is ready to be communicated.

My personal rule of thumb for this is as follows:

1. Have an idea and explore it thoroughly through whatever means suitable.

2. Work towards having a mental sketch of what this idea could lead to.

3. When you start feeling like you want to share the idea with someone, share it.
