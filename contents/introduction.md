# Why This Book? ðŸ“–

I did not intend to write this book.
Yet, here I am, straddling a log above a brook log listening to the soothing symphony of the running water juxtaposed against the harsh whir of cars on the main roadway not more than a rocks throw from where I precariously sit.
And I suppose, that this description is a very apt analogy for how I found myself writing this book.

Away from the wooded groves and busy streets, for a majority of my life I have found myself not enjoying the vivacious odor of leaves and pines, but musty books and freshly steeped tea.
As both a professional student and at-times independent, at-times employed researcher, I have observed an interesting phenomena that can best be characterized as "intellectual waste".
What I mean by this is that I have the great fortune and privilege of being frequently surrounded by brilliant people.
Medical doctors, lawyers, company founders - I often interact and even share the occasional coffee or cocoa with stunning minds such as these.
Although brilliant, a common observation I have made amongst these professionals from my perch on my proverbial "log" is the lack of intellectual organization.

I vividly remember one conversation with a colleague of mine - a prolific mathematician turned bioninformatician - on the matter of note taking during literature reviews.
As a rather novice, though not inexperienced, researcher at the time, I held great respect for this colleague's thoughts and was eager to hear how he conducted his work.
The colleague opened a directory on his personal computer and showed me a plethora of different sub-directories, each containing notes and thoughts on particular papers.
It was no shock that it contained so many notes, but I couldn't help but wonder: "How could they find anything when they needed it?" 
When I asked about how easy it was to find a particular fact or piece information from this system, the answer was given with a sheepish grin: "Not very."
That question was the catalyst which spurred me to take the question of how to reduce intellectual waste very seriously - especially as I began my own journey as a researcher.

Before you read another word, let me lay out exactly what this book will discuss - and more importantly, what it _won't_.
