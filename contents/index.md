# What Is This Book? 🤔 {-}

This book is what I wish I had in my process growing as a young researcher and investigator. 
Although I am a young investigator currently, I think this perspective of actively growing and learning through my interactions with academia is useful.
My goal is that this book will provide readers general insights into how they can manage their research throughout their careers.

I do not expect you, the reader, to read this entire book.
Rather, the book is designed and written in such a way for readers to quickly read what they want.
The chapters, though useful as an entire book, can be read as self-contained articles.
