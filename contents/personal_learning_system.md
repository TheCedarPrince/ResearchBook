# Knowledge Building ðŸ“š

This chapter concerns what I have come across in my educational practices as being of extreme use to me as a researcher and student.
The information provided here encapsulates a variety of information and techniques one can make use of in their studies or research.
Here are the executive summaries of each section:

**-@sec:screening-heuristics Screening Heuristics** - these are some of my own heuristics I use when scanning media.
I encourage you to let these inspire you in creating your own heuristics!

**-@sec:spacing-effect The Spacing Effect** - the spacing effect is a useful way to schedule your learning for maximum retention and understanding of material.

**-@sec:spaced-repetition-systems Spaced Repetition Systems** - modern tools and suggestions on how to incorporate the spacing effect into your learning.

**-@sec:incremental-reading Incremental Reading** - a paradigm to read multiple pieces of information at once to maximize reading while learning.

These sections expose you to many ideas that can help with you developing your own learning process.
Later chapters go more into how to connect all of this together in a more practical manner.

## Screening Heuristics {#sec:screening-heuristics}

When faced with a piece of media to consume, I apply the following heuristics to determine if it is worth my time:

1. **Do I want to consume this?** Often, I open media after reading the title and sub-heading. If it sounds interesting, I might process it, if not: pass. 

2. **Am I motivated to process this?** If I am not motivated to process a piece of media, I either throw it out or save it for processing later. If I keep it and have not processed it after some arbitrary time, I don't bother processing it and throw it out.

3. **Do I find the main thesis of the piece intriguing?** I will jump from the beginning to the end of a piece. If the thesis seems intriguing to me I will investigate the conclusion. If the ending convincingly ties itself back to the thesis, I deem it worth my time. If it fails any of these moments, I throw it out.

To qualify these heuristics, an explanation. I operate under the implicit assumption that time is scarce. Every thing wants your time. Therefore, it is imperative to triage valuable information from noise. I rationalize that the cost of missing something in my screening process is low. If a piece is worth my time, I will be led back to it. 

Furthermore, I am a selfish in my consumption of media. I choose to consume that which I wish to consume. While processing a piece of media, I may skip around in it until I find something interesting.

## The Spacing Effect {#sec:spacing-effect}

The spacing effect accounts for the fact that learning is improved when studying is spread out over time. It was first discovered and described by Hermann Ebbinghaus during 1880 - 1885. [@ebbinghaus1885ueber] His findings were later accurately reproduced and documented by *Murre & Dros*. [@murreReplicationAnalysisEbbinghaus2015] [(Click for results of that study here)](05282020172154-replication-ebbinghaus.md)

The spacing effect has not been very well utilized in US-based education institutes despite its multitudinous benefits. [@dempsterCaseStudyFailure1988] Cepeda et al. determined that in a memory based challenge, spaced based learning outperformed massed learning ~96% of the time. [@cepeda2006distributed] This coincides with the deficient processing view posited by Hintzman that stated how massed repetition leads to a lack of attention in later reviews. [@hintzman1974theoretical]

According to *Pyc and Rawson*, labored but correct recall while practicing improves memory. Spacing items of recall produce greater effort during retrieval and enables thorough conversion of the item to memory. [^1] [@pyc2009testing] Semantic processing of information during repetitions assists in making that information more [anti-fragile, to borrow from Nassim Taleb,](03172020033742-antifragility.md) during reviews. This causes performance in later memory testing to be unaffected by changes in such things like the type of font used when presented information. [^2] [@mammarella2002spacing] 

A confounding factor in the idea of the spacing effect is the encoding variability theory. This theory states that one's performance on a memory test is related to overlaps amongst current contextualized material both during testing and  while encoding. According to this view, spaced repetition typically entails some variability in presentation contexts. Yet, this results in a positive outcome being that there are then more retrieval cues associated with that material. [@cormier2014basic]

However, there are concerns about the spacing effect that have impeded its overall adoption into educational formats. *Dempster* made a case examining potential rationales for the lack of adoption in a review of the current state of the spacing effect (though the study is old over 30 years old, it still remains that education systems do not incorporate the spacing effect). [@dempsterCaseStudyFailure1988] His biggest point of concern was the lack of studies that showed effective classroom utilization of the method.

## Spaced Repetition Systems {#sec:spaced-repetition-systems}

Despite such misgivings, it is still a phenomenon that have given rise to many benefits and potential applications for at least personal education. 
Principle of which is in the form of [spaced repetition systems.](05252020183020-spaced-repetition-systems.md) 
These systems have determined the best spacing algorithms for a learner to use the spacing effect to assist in learning diverse educational material.

There are multiple algorithms available used for effectively implementing the spacing effect. The earliest algorithm comes from the original discoverer of the spacing effect, Hermann Ebbinghaus. The algorithm [has been replicated](05282020172154-replication-ebbinghaus.md) and scrutinized examined multiple times. [@murreReplicationAnalysisEbbinghaus2015; @ebbinghaus1885ueber; @bjork2011making] Spaced repetition systems are based around proper implementations of such algorithms.

Before the advent of computers, it was very difficult to implement such a system. The best system to take advantage of this effect was the [Leitner System which used paper note cards](05102020220941-leitner-system.md) to assist with remembering information. [@sebastianleitnerLerntManLernen1972] However, this was still a somewhat fragile system and difficult to manage.

With computers, there have been several pieces of software made to automate and keep track of repetitions *for a learner*. A majority of these systems directly adapted the Leitner System from the analog to the digital world. Each software generally has proprietary algorithms that supposedly maximize the spacing effect but are directly inspired by the original work done by Ebbinghaus.

Whether analog or digital, key features of these systems are as follows:

1. Uses an algorithm implementation of the spacing effect for a user.
2. Each piece of information is spaced automatically per a user's perceived difficulty in either remembering or processing that piece of information on a repetition.
3. Pieces of information are generally presented in a "flashcard" format and are stored in "decks". 

## Incremental Reading {#sec:incremental-reading}

Piotr WoÅºniak, a Polish learning researcher, is thought to be the originator of the term and process of "incremental reading". Incremental reading is a methodology that enables one to process multiple written pieces concurrently over several days while promoting learning. The methodology follows this general format:

1. Identify written pieces of interest.
2. Prioritize the pieces according to personal urgency. Adjust while reading.
3. Allocate a comfortable reading time duration per piece with a timed, short break in-between. [^1]
4. While reading each piece, annotate material that is of interest or difficult to process.
5. Transfer annotations from each piece to an index card representation (actual or digital).
6. Pause reading and review collected annotations using a spaced repetition system.
7. Once annotations have been thoroughly revised and reviewed, repeat from step 2 until finished with pieces over the next several days.

Incremental reading aids attention and encourages better retention via intermittent breaks and mixing of reading materials, respectively. [^2] [@bjork2011making; @shea1979contextual; @arigaBriefRareMental2011] Ingesting raw annotations into a spaced repetition system makes processing them manageable as the cards they are written appear at spaced intervals. On each appearance of a card, one can rewrite or modify that card; further cementing it in memory. [^3] [@bjork2011making] After finishing revisions and reviews, this general process is repeated until done with reading the pieces.
