<h1 data-number="1" id="why-this-book"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Why This Book? 📖</h1>
<p>I did not intend to write this book. Yet, here I am, straddling a log above a brook log listening to the soothing symphony of the running water juxtaposed against the harsh whir of cars on the main roadway not more than a rocks throw from where I precariously sit. And I suppose, that this description is a very apt analogy for how I found myself writing this book.</p>
<p>Away from the wooded groves and busy streets, for a majority of my life I have found myself not enjoying the vivacious odor of leaves and pines, but musty books and freshly steeped tea. As both a professional student and at-times independent, at-times employed researcher, I have observed an interesting phenomena that can best be characterized as “intellectual waste.” What I mean by this is that I have the great fortune and privilege of being frequently surrounded by brilliant people. Medical doctors, lawyers, company founders - I often interact and even share the occasional coffee or cocoa with stunning minds such as these. Although brilliant, a common observation I have made amongst these professionals from my perch on my proverbial “log” is the lack of intellectual organization.</p>
<p>I vividly remember one conversation with a colleague of mine - a prolific mathematician turned bioninformatician - on the matter of note taking during literature reviews. As a rather novice, though not inexperienced, researcher at the time, I held great respect for this colleague’s thoughts and was eager to hear how he conducted his work. The colleague opened a directory on his personal computer and showed me a plethora of different sub-directories, each containing notes and thoughts on particular papers. It was no shock that it contained so many notes, but I couldn’t help but wonder: “How could they find anything when they needed it?” When I asked about how easy it was to find a particular fact or piece information from this system, the answer was given with a sheepish grin: “Not very.” That question was the catalyst which spurred me to take the question of how to reduce intellectual waste very seriously - especially as I began my own journey as a researcher.</p>
<p>Before you read another word, let me lay out exactly what this book will discuss - and more importantly, what it <em>won’t</em>.</p>
